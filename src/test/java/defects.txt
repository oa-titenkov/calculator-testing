1. sum, sub, mult, div methods use double values which leads to rounding errors
2. mult method with double inputs has unnecessary Math.floor on result
3. div method with double input doesn't have divide by zero catch
4. div method returns only long values
5. pow method has Math.floor in it
6. abs method in sqrt
7. cos, tg, ctg have wrong formulas

(?)isPositive, isNegative don't take doubles
